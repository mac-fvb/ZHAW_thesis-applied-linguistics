## LaTeX Template

The thesis is based on the [ZHAW_thesis-template](https://github.com/matteodelucchi/ZHAW_thesis-template) by [Matteo de Lucchi](https://github.com/matteodelucchi/). I encourage you to refer to Matteo&apos;s much cleaner original template. This version has been modified extensively to meet the criteria of the School of Applied Linguistics.

If you are looking for a template that is close to the requirements of ZHAW&apos;s School of Applied Linguistics, have a look in my thesis and copy what you need.

It is very convenient to use Matteo&apos; template in [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/). See his GitHub page for more information on this. I found the combination of VisualStudio Code and Github very convenient for writing.
